			<h1><?php echo $pageTitle; ?></h1>
			<p>Keys School is an elementary and middle school operating in a highly competitive market in Palo Alto, CA. They needed a new website to set them apart from the competition while emphasizing their whole-child approach to education. </p>

            <p>Initial wireframe concepts were designed with the idea of a grid of flexible modules, with different arrangements of photos, text, quotes, etc. The modules could be chosen and ordered within the CMS to create a variety of page designs, each tailored to the content of the page. </p>

            <p>In the design stage the idea of flexible page layouts evolved to take advantage of photos with transparent backgrounds. The revised functionality allowed users to combine photos, SVG patterns, and colors all through WordPress to create fun, dynamic pages.</p>
