CauseEngine wanted an updated website to reflect adjustments in their business strategy, as well as to take advantage of changes to user registration in the back-end.</p>

                <p>The previous sales approach of CauseEngine was a 50/50 split between appealing to non-profits and creatives. The new approach was to place much more emphasis on the non-profit clients, and extend CauseEngine’s messaging to their consulting services. To achieve this we added success stories near the top of the page, and centered the content of the page around CauseEngine’s value proposition, the Three Ps: People, Platform, and Plan.</p>

                <p>Building upon the application originally created by O3 World, I designed a new user flow for the process of posting a project on CauseEngine. The new process guides users through a few simple steps while providing numerous supporting hints to help them get exactly the kind of work they need.</p>
