                <p>After discussions with the Vynamic team about how to develop an app that incentivized organic bonds between longtime and new employees, I created a mobile app concept based on the idea of orbits and gravity. As you get to know your coworkers better, they move into a closer orbit to you. Initial ideas included awarding points for attending company events, or just snapping a selfie with your coworkers while out for a beer.</p>

                <p>In further revisions and feedback from the Vynamic team, the app was simplified to award points through different quiz games.</p>

                <p>Due to unsurety in the evolving feature set the app wasn't pursued past the wireframe phase. I still believe in the general concept, and that with further exploration and more consideration to how points are awarded, the app could achieve its original goal and encourage employees in a large company to create stronger bonds.</p>
