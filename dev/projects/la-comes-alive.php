			<p>LA Comes Alive was a concept for marketing the Los Angeles Convention Center, creating a guest experience unique to Los Angeles. Guests of the convention center can experience the food and culture of LA’s diverse neighborhoods from within the center itself. This book serves as a graphic overview for this new plan.</p>
			<p>Inspired by Los Angeles’ vibrant art scene, I created a system of icons based on street art stickers to guide the reader through the neighborhoods and themes. “Stickers” in other styles add a collage-like look to the cover.</p>
