			<p>An extension of the PHL: Here for the Making campaign, the PHL Made concept was designed to shine a spotlight on the makers movement in Philadelphia and support its growth, through a directory of local resources and videos of local makers by videographer Cory J. Popp.</p>
			<p>The logo depicts the letters PHL as an industrial building—referencing Philadelphia’s past as the “Workshop of the World,” as well as the current repurposing of these structures for creative use.</p>
