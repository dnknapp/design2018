                <div class="caption">I was tasked with the creation of two logos for the Brian Jordan Foundation. The monogram logo serves a more formal function for Foundation correspondence, fundraising, etc. The animal concepts function more like a mascot, for use during events like youth baseball camps. The owl and lioness were chosen for exploration as animals that are both wise and athletic. The red and navy color palette reflects Jordan’s time as a player for the Atlanta Braves.</div>

                <div class="caption">Loanability provides quick business loans. In these concepts I wanted to create a simple, memorable icon to represent their services: an “L” that is a wallet full of cash, and a dollar sign transformed into a hopping rabbit.</div>
