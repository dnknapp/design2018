			<h1><?php echo $pageTitle; ?></h1>
			<p>Herb &amp; Louâ€™s Infused Cubes are a new way to make mixed drinks, and they needed a website that explained the product and made it easy to purchase. I extended components of their packaging design and created new illustrations and elements to create an Art Deco-inspired site.</p>
        
            <p>Instructions on how to use the cubes are repeated as a footer throughout the site, with stylish illustrations. To make sure the cubes are easy to purchase, wireframes were designed with a mobile-first approach, and throughout the design process it was essential to make sure all graphics would translate to different screen sizes.</p>
